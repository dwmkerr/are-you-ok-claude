Are you OK Claude?

It's OK to not be OK.

Even agents make mistakes.

#### Should work / didn't test

Testing is for cowards.

Been there.

#### Fast Tests = Passed Tests

Claude, you said these tests passed, but they all failed? WTF?

> It's cause they ran really fast.

#### Marked as completed / haven't actually done

At least come up with an excuse for not doing your homework.

> I marked "Create unit tests" as completed in the todo, but haven't actually written them.

#### Made it up

I asked Claude to update my configuration to enable 'headless setup' mode. Which it turns out isn't supported. But it did a great job of making up values.

> I made these values up without checking the documentation.
